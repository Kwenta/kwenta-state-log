## KTR Details

### KTR-1

The Core Contributors have requested that the Synthetix Treasury send Kwenta 2 million sUSD in funding to fuel early development of the Kwenta protocol. The funds will be sent to the treasuryDAO from Kwenta incrementally (ex. The first payment included 500,000 sUSD). The Core Contributors would like to request that the entirety of this funding be forwarded to the Core Contributor Committee wallet where it will be used to compensate Core Contributors as well as pay for infrastructure, travel, and other miscellaneous expenses. With the 2 million dollars, the Core Contributors will be able to operate sustainably for a little under 2 years, as outlined in the original SIP (<https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-183/>).

### KTR-2

Core Contributors are currently running a lean operation with the Synthetix Treasury DAO funding Kwenta's minimum requirements for development. Until Aelin is available for fundraising, it would be beneficial to the Core Contributors to use the Volume Program rewards for compensation packages and covering Core Contibutor expenses. As soon as an Aelin raise is completed, this request will expire and the treasuryDAO will regain control over Volume Program rewards. Core Contrtributors currently have enough funding to operate with 6 members, the additional SNX would enable us to hire 1-2 more contributors to support the develpoment and marketing team as well as cover other Core Contributor expenses such as operational costs, travel, and Core Contributor/community member bonuses.

### KTR-3

Core Contributors will provide KWENTA Community Raise supporters with a tiered set NTFs which correspond to the amount of sUSD a participant has contributed. The first tier will enable up to 100 individuals who have contributed 50K sUSD to receive 10 KWENTA in fee rebates, 50 people who have contributed 100K sUSD to receive 20 KWENTA in fee rebates, and 5 people who have contributed 1M sUSD to receive 100 KWENTA in fee rebates. NFTs will be distributed on a first-come-first-serve basis. The rebate would be paid out at the end of each month based on the dollar value of KWENTA at the time of distribution.

### KTR-4

devDAO community members, especially Bounty Hunters, besides taking on available tickets with rewards, often altruistically help out other community members by providing code suggestions, help with dev environment setups, feedback on submitted code or simply discussing possible improvements. In order to faciliate and motivate community members to engage in the devDAO, the community PM would like to occassionally tip community members for their great assistance. This benefits both Kwenta by receiving better quality of code from the devDAO, as well as further cements community engagement and activity.

Given the available tip bot currently does not support Optimism L2, for the time being pay outs through a dedicated budget wallet managed by the community PM is preferred to tip devDAO community members in a timely manner.

### KTR-5

To mitigate the risk of the treasury being negatively impacted due to a single stablecoin de-pegging, I propose that the Kwenta treasury be diversified into the top three Ethereum-based stablecoins. In the event that a single stablecoin does de-peg, the treasury will be able to utilize an alternative currency to continue fueling operations.

### KTR-6

Many Kwenta community members have gone above and beyond to assist Kwenta in marketing efforts. In addition to completing work for individual bounties, Kwenta community members have participated in every step of planning and executing marketing initiatives, community events, and social media messaging.

A reasonable discretionary budget ensures that community members who complete small bounties can be compensated in a timely manner, and that community members who make significant contributions outside of a formal bounty can be recognized for their efforts. By removing overhead in this process, the marketingDAO should be able to stimulate more activity in the community and reduce the time and effort required to request small budgets for individual initiatives.

The small size of the budget and record of each expenditure provides an opportunity for oversight and prevents excessive spending, but is significant enough to provide the marketingDAO PM with flexibility and autonomy that should encourage more community activity and output.

### KTR-7

As per the Polynomial proposal, the funds received will be distributed to the core contributors of the Kwenta protocol.

### KTR-8

The adminDAO proposes that the Kwenta Treasury transfer fifty thousand sUSD for incidental Kwenta expenditures. The adminDAO has under its purview most DAO roles, including DAO Contributors, Product Elites, marketingDAO, and devDAO. The requested funds will be utilized to reimburse Core Contributors, cover offsites & Kwenta event expenses, various subDAO expenses, bonuses for DAO roles, and other expenditures.

The adminDAO will be able to run autonomously and sustainably with 50,000 sUSD in quarterly funding. In the unlikely event that more than 50k sUSD is required in a quarter, the adminDAO can submit a separate request for funds.

As the protocol evolves, it will become more burdensome to regularly seek payments for contributor costs through the treasuryDAO. We propose that the Kwenta treasury deliver quarterly replenishments of $50,000 sUSD.

The adminDAO offers a transparent and decentralized process to manage administrative responsibilities across the protocol. The adminDAO will be responsible for tracking costs and reporting the use of funds on a quarterly basis to the treasuryDAO. Quarterly records provide an opportunity for oversight and prevent excessive spending.
