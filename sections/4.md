## Roadmap Development Process

Any time a new council is voted in, it will be the responsibility of the Elite Council, in collaboration with Management Contributors, Core Contributors, and adminDAO to establish a refreshed roadmap. The roadmap will need to pass a feasibility check by all Core Contributors (CCs) where consensus is reached amongst CCs that they are comfortable with the scope of work and direction. If the roadmap does not receive majority support within the Elite Council or amongst CCs, the roadmap will need to be adjusted until it passes both checks.

Once the roadmap is approved, the Core Contributors will work to establish a delivery schedule reflective of the roadmap. As new KIPs are introduced, the CCs will be tasked with updating the delivery schedule to accommodate for the newly passed KIPs.

Milestones on the roadmap will include budgets of KWENTA bonuses for the adminDAO to distribute according to the involvement of relevant Contributors if the milestones are completed. The milestone bonuses are not bound by the dates they are scheduled for as there will inevitably be delays; additionally incentivizing early completion will drive timely development. The treasuryDAO will send the KWENTA to the adminDAO upon confirmed completion of a given milestone. It will be the responsibility of the Elite Council to confirm once a milestone has been reached. It will be the responsibility of the Management Contributors to define what qualifies as a completed milestone. It will be the responsibility of the treasuryDAO to determine a given epoch roadmap's milestone rewards budget.

## Decentralized Deployment

The Kwenta frontend source code and Kwenta State Log (KSL) are hosted both on GitHub and distributed through a decentralized code collaboration network called Radicle. The elected Elite Council votes on the repositories it officially endorses.
 The Elite Council and Core Contributors manage a multisig which requires 2/6 votes, 5 of which are held by Elite Council members and 1 of which is held by the Core Contributors (any Core Contributor).
 
### Frontend

 Transaction-based execution directs which version of the code the official Kwenta ENS is pointing to on IPFS. This official version of Kwenta can be reached at: <https://kwenta.eth.limo> or <ipns://kwenta.eth>.

### Code Repository

The endorsed decentralized code project for Kwenta is:

`rad:git:hnrkdc9jh3a1ud7k3spy9pper1ptbkh55yy5y`

And can be found at: <https://kwenta-gov.on.fleek.co/seeds/maple.radicle.garden/rad:git:hnrkdc9jh3a1ud7k3spy9pper1ptbkh55yy5y/tree> or on Github at: <https://github.com/Kwenta/kwenta>

### Kwenta State Log Repository

The endorsed decentralized code project for the KSL is:

`rad:git:hnrkq1oex148yz4zi9tm7spfnjaryyuc93yay`

### Radicle Note

Due to Radicles current limitations while under active development, active development of the frontend code repository and code collaboration of the Kwenta State Log are taking place on GitHub. 

In case of disagreements, abandonment or forks of the endorsed Kwenta source code project, community members can put forward requests to the Elite Council in order to vote on alternative project ids being supported and officially endorsed.


## Asset Listing Process

In the event the Synthetix protocol supports a new synth, the Kwenta protocol will automatically list the asset and make it available for use in the product. Kwenta shall not take custodial control over users' assets and shall continue to act as a decentralized trading protocol.

## Synth Swap

Leveraging 1inch (smart contracts and API) and Synthetix, Kwenta will enable the exchange of any ERC20 tokens for any synths (and vice versa) directly on its platform. The first iteration will support most ERC20 tokens that can be swapped on 1inch but will withhold the ability to add custom tokens for swaps.

### Specification

User Flows: As a spot trader, I want:

* Spot exposure with synthetic assets:
    * By swapping my ERC20 tokens or ETH for synths
* To leave the ecosystem:
    * By swapping my synths for ERC20 tokens or ETH

As a futures trader, I want:
* To open positions:
    * By swapping my ERC20 tokens or ETH for sUSD margin

SynthSwap smart contracts utilize both 1inch and Synthetix to execute ERC20 token swaps. SynthSwap provides swap functionality for ETH and 1inch supported ERC20 tokens to synths and vice-versa. Swap aggregation data is generated off-chain via 1inch's API and used on-chain to efficiently execute token exchange through 1inch smart contracts. The Synthetix exchange fills in the last leg of the swap if needed (if swapping Synth <-> Synth). This allows for users to go from ETH to sETH in one transaction vs previously having to go from ETH to sUSD and then a separate transaction for sUSD to sETH.

* Kwenta aggregator contracts: github.com/Kwenta/synthswap

## Socket Plugin

The Socket Plugin offers a user-friendly, multichain experience with minimal resource allocation for integration and developer overhead. It currently supports multichain swaps between Optimism, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Aurora in a single transaction. This integration will improve onboarding for users across the DeFi ecosystem.

### Specification
The Socket Plugin contracts interact with the Socket Liquidity Layer, which aggregates various bridge and DEX aggregators.  The swap functionality will offer synthetic assets from Synthetix, where available, on their native chains.

This allows users to start from any token on any of the supported chains and exchange it into a new token on the chain of their choice. For example, a user could hold ETH on Arbitrum, bridge and exchange it into sUSD on Optimism, and deposit it directly into their trading account.

## Cross-Margin v2.0.0 (CMv2)

The core Cross-Margin v2.0.0 improvement includes support for Synthetix Perps V2, which provides users with a better trading experience with decreased fees and other improvements.

Secondary improvements include an architecture rework to support account upgradability and versioning, traditional cross-margin optionality, and new order types/strategies. Among those types and strategies are reduce-only orders, batched orders, and conditional orders (replacing advanced orders).

### Specification

#### Synthetix Perps V2

As defined by [SIP-281](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-281), orders may now be delayed to improve trading; thus, our current atomic trading system must be updated. Instead of simply executing an order immediately, orders are submitted in one transaction and executed after a delay in another transaction. Execution is not limited to the order-submitting account but can be executed by any caller. We will replace all instances of the function `modifyPositionWithTracking` with `submitOffchainDelayedOrderWithTracking` and leave order execution up to either the user or another external party (such as a keeper).

SIP-281 will also have significant implications concerning conditional orders. Conditional orders must be carefully built to balance risk and usability. Thus, strategies to prevent bad actors will be in place and discussed later in the conditional orders section.

#### System Upgradeability

Cross-Margin v1 (CMv1) does not support contract upgradeability, and the protocol logic is only compatible with Synthetix Perps V1. Due to this, all protocol contracts must be redeployed to support Perps V2 interaction.

Future upgrades to the protocol will require the same steps unless upgradability is introduced. Currently, margin accounts are created per user and are minimal proxies as defined by [EIP-1167](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167). The implementation address typically could not be changed; however, deploying a proxy that forwards all calls from each minimal proxy to another logic contract enables the protocol to upgrade margin account logic without the need to redeploy another account. A proof of concept of this system design has been implemented and tested here: https://github.com/JaredBorders/upgradable-minimal-proxy.

Furthermore, adding account versioning and a permanent contract store that tracks deployed accounts and the respective deployer will simplify frontend interaction and account tracking. Reducing subgraph reliance will decrease frontend load and improve performance. The store will also track verified factory addresses, ensuring that only trusted sources can update tracked accounts.

#### Order Execution

CMv1 relies on position-defining objects to dictate logic execution regarding placing/modifying/closing positions. As strategies and the underlying protocol grows in complexity, upgradability will become increasingly difficult. Furthermore, CMv1 bundles multiple calls to Synthetix in an order-specific fashion that cannot be decoupled resulting in decreased flexibility.

CMv2 will break down order state by specifying individual commands to execute, relying solely on the caller to determine what action(s) they wish to perform. Upgrading functionality that maps one-to-one with Perps V2 and beyond will become as trivial as adding a new function and command key. The latter will be represented as an enum and passed to an "execute" function in the CMv2 contracts alongside necessary input parameters.

#### Traditional Cross-Margin

Traditional cross-margin shares account margin across all positions. However, due to the isolated nature of Synthetix's implementation of perps markets, directly sharing margin is not possible. 

CMv2 will introduce optional account access to user-approved addresses that will allow approved addresses to deposit/withdraw margin on behalf of users. These approved addresses can belong to Kwenta-designed keepers that can execute account margin rebalancing during certain account conditions (such as approaching liquidation). They can also belong to the third-party designed trading bots that offer a similar service. This design will increase account flexibility and incentivize others to improve the trading experience for Kwenta users.

##### New Order Types/Strategies

#### Conditional Orders (previously Advanced Orders)

Conditional orders (ex: limit/stop-loss) must be reimagined for Perps V2’s delayed orders. Submitting an order once certain market conditions are met does not guarantee that post delay, the execution price will still be valid. Furthermore, price feeds previously were atomic and on-chain, allowing a keeper (Gelato) to poll Synthetix markets to determine if an order is ready to be executed. 

This changes with Perps V2. To ensure keepers submit valid orders, we will implement our version of price feed verification very similar to what Synthetix uses for executing delayed off-chain orders, which requires a price feed that is then verified on-chain. We will also redefine our advanced orders as conditional orders to highlight the conditional aspect of our new orders and the divergence from traditional advanced market order syntax.

#### Reduce-Only Orders

In existing markets, reduce only orders allow traders to place orders that only reduce the current position. This ensures, when there exists an **active order and active position** and the position is either modified or closed out, the remaining order doesn’t re-open or extend the current position. CMv2 will include a new option to restrict orders to reduce only.

#### Batched Orders

CMv2 will implement new functions that allow complex order composition that combines market and conditional orders in a single transaction. This addition will require a minor update of the new order-defining data structure. Providing a means for users to open a position and define conditional orders that prevent loss or realize gains in a single transaction will significantly improve the trader experience.

## Lyra Hosting Pilot

The Lyra Hosting Pilot KIP agrees to the terms defined in LEAP-43 approved by the Lyra Council, and proposed by the Kwenta DAO. 

Kwenta will be the  first third party interface deployer of the Lyra protocol. This will involve Kwenta hosting its own interface (the Kwenta Interface) that provides users with access to trade Lyra protocol sourced options for the 6-month pilot period.

## Specification
During the Pilot:

Lyra will provide Kwenta with:
* Access to the Lyra interface to develop and host its own interface (the Kwenta Interface);
* Access to the Lyra protocol to support the Kwenta Interface;
* A grant of  400,000 LYRA to undertake the Pilot, to be paid linearly in monthly installments (subject to Lyra DAO review throughout the Pilot); ∏Support from Lyra DAO Core Contributors, including weekly meetings, open ended sync communications channels and technical support for disruptions between Kwenta Interface and the Lyra protocol.

Kwenta will:
* Develop and host the Kwenta Interface to be made available to Kwenta users on the Kwenta exchange (kwenta.eth.limo);
* Deploy the Kwenta Interface to provide users with access to Lyra sourced options only;
* Not charge any additional fees to users accessing the Lyra protocol through the Kwenta Interface;
* Not in any way indicate that it can bind Lyra DAO;
* Only deal with the LYRA tokens provided in connection with the Pilot through staking, and will not ‘dump sell’ any LYRA tokens;

Prior to the end of the Pilot period, develop a subsequent LEAP proposing the terms of any ongoing commercial arrangement between Kwenta and Lyra with respect to the Kwenta Interface.

This arrangement is not intended to be exclusive and Lyra DAO may provide services to other parties providing interfaces with Lyra protocol. If engagement during the Pilot indicates that a longer term commercial arrangement with Lyra is not in the best interests of Kwenta, a disengagement plan will be agreed upon and implemented.
