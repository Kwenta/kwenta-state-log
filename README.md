# Kwenta State Log

The Kwenta State Log (KSL) is a living document which defines the state of Kwenta. Amendments and additions can be made to the KSL via a Kwenta Improvement Proposal (KIP).

To propose a KIP to the Kwenta State Log, use the [KIP-0 template](./templates/kip-0.md). For more information, see [KIP workflow](./sections/1.md#kip-workflow).

KIPs currently up for discussion can be found in the [drafts folder](./kips/drafts/).
