title: <Orphaned Entity Establishment Costs>

## Summary

Fund the adminDAO with the necessary funds to establish the orphaned entity proposed in [KIP-67](https://gov.kwenta.eth.limo/kips/kip-067/).

## Request

The immediate fees include an invoice for 35,801 USDC however this KTR will request 70,000 USDC to manage future anticipated costs as well for this year. This quantity can be sent in SNX and converted to USDC by the adminDAO. 

## Address

`oeth:0xF510a2Ff7e9DD7e18629137adA4eb56B9c13E885`

## Rationale

The adminDAO has now developed a strict budget on how the entity intends on using funds held to manage resources. The establishment of the orphaned entity falls outside of the scope of that budget and therefore warrants a seperate KTR.
