The adminDAO remained under budget during the last epoch, having requested $1,530,000 but spent only $1,130,000, resulting in a stablecoin surplus of approximately $400,000. Accordingly, we have reduced our funding request by a similar amount, setting our total ask for the current period at $1,103,535.68. Additionally, the adminDAO is seeking an allocation of 56,750 $KWENTA tokens to implement KIP-85 for the 2024 Core Contributors.
