## Summary
This Kwenta Improvement Proposal (KIP) suggests the addition of multi-language support to the Kwenta platform. The goal is to make Kwenta more accessible and user-friendly for non-English speaking communities by offering an interface and user experience in multiple languages.
## Motivation
Kwenta is a globally used decentralized trading platform with a user base that spans multiple countries and linguistic backgrounds. Currently, the platform is only available in English, which may limit its usability and adoption among non-English speakers. By adding multi-language support, Kwenta can attract a broader audience, enhance user experience, and foster greater inclusivity within the crypto trading community.
- Increased Accessibility: Expanding the platform's language offerings will make it accessible to users who are not proficient in English, allowing them to engage more effectively with the platform.
- Broader User Base: Multi-language support can help Kwenta reach new markets and grow its user base in regions where English is not the primary language.
- Improved User Experience: Providing users with an interface in their native language can enhance their overall experience, making them more likely to continue using Kwenta and recommending it to others.
- Competitive Advantage: Multi-language support can differentiate Kwenta from other platforms that may not offer this feature, giving it a competitive edge.

## Specification
The initial implementation will support the following languages, based on market research and community demand:
- Spanish
- Mandarin Chinese
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Korean
- Portuguese
- Russian
Future updates can add more languages based on user feedback and analytics.

#### Language Selection
Frontend Integration: A language selection dropdown will be added to the platform's user interface, allowing users to switch between supported languages.
Auto-Detection: The platform should attempt to auto-detect the user's preferred language based on their browser settings, with the option to manually override this setting.
Persistent Settings: The selected language will be stored in the user's preferences and will persist across sessions.

#### Content Translation
User Interface: All UI elements, including buttons, menus, tooltips, and error messages, will be translated into the supported languages.
Documentation: Essential platform documentation and tutorials will also be translated, ensuring that users can access learning resources in their native language.
Customer Support: A multilingual support system will be established, offering help and troubleshooting in the supported languages.

#### Technical Considerations
Localization Framework: The platform will integrate a robust localization framework (e.g., i18n) that supports dynamic language switching and content management.
Translation Management: A translation management tool (e.g., Transifex, Crowdin) will be used to facilitate the translation process and ensure that content updates are synchronized across all languages.
Quality Assurance: Native speakers will review all translations to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness. Continuous feedback loops will be established for ongoing improvements.

#### Milestones
**Phase 1:** Planning and Research
Conduct market research to prioritize languages.
Set up translation management infrastructure.
Identify and onboard translation and localization experts.
 
**Phase 2:** Implementation

Monitor performance and gather user feedback.
Plan for future language additions and updates.

This KIP addresses the growing need for inclusivity and accessibility in the global crypto trading space. By implementing multi-language support, Kwenta can tap into new markets, foster community growth, and enhance the user experience for non-English speakers. The proposed approach ensures a scalable and flexible solution, allowing for future expansion of language offerings as the platform grows. The implementation will be carried out by the Kwenta development team in collaboration with professional translators and localization experts. The project will be divided into phases, with regular updates provided to the community. The team will also conduct extensive testing to ensure that the multi-language support works seamlessly across all devices and platforms.
