## Simple Summary

Introduce a comprehensive points system to reward Kwenta users for their engagement, including both retroactive and ongoing contributions, with room for expansion for special campaigns.

## Abstract

This proposal seeks to establish a Kwenta Points System, distributing points for trading, referrals, and a special incentive for established users of perps protocols. Points track the distribution of both ongoing weekly rewards and retroactive rewards at the time of $KSX token generation.

## Motivation

The proposal aims to incentivize and reward community engagement, support for early v3 platform testing, governance participation, and constructive feedback. By recognizing user contributions and involvement, the system seeks to foster a more vibrant, engaged, and growing Kwenta community.

## Specification

The Kwenta Council will choose a start date based on Core Contributor guidance using an informal poll. 

### Kwenta Rewards Credits:

Kwenta Rewards Credits will accumulate weekly and reset each epoch. At the end of each epoch, users will earn rewards from a weekly pool proportional to their share of total credits for the week.

- **Synthetix Base Trading Rewards:** 10 credits per $1 in volume.
- **Synthetix Arbitrum Trading Rewards:** 10 credits per $1 in volume.
- **Synthetix V2 Trading Rewards:** 10 credits per $1 in volume.
- **Perennial Trading Rewards:** 10 credits per $1 in volume.

### VIP Tier Multiplier:

Each VIP tier achieved will reward users with a 25% additional boost in ongoing rewards from trading, with a 100% boost achievable at the top tier. Credits VIP tiers apply to all chains and match the tiers of the zkVIP program.

### Affiliate Program Ongoing:

Affiliates earn 1 credit for every 5 credits earned by referred wallets for weekly rewards.

### Kwenta Experience Points (EXP):

- Kwenta Experience Points accumulate as a total count until the $KSX token generation event. This points designation will count toward $KSX rewards at the token generation event.

### Retroactive Rewards:

#### For trades prior to May 23rd at 00:00 UTC:
  - Trading on v3: 1 EXP per $1 in volume.
#### Active Perps Trader Incentives:
  - For addresses found to have done $1m or greater historical volume before May 23rd, 2024 on any of GMX, Gains Trade, MUX, Vertex, or Synthetix v2 Perps frontend (including Kwenta), 100,000 bonus EXP will be awarded for completing $100,000 in volume before $KSX token generation.

### Weekly EXP:

- For every 100 credits earned at the end of each week, Kwenta users will earn 1 EXP.

### Affiliate Program EXP:

- Affiliates will earn 1 EXP for every 5 EXP earned by referred wallets.

### Manual EXP and Credits Distribution:

Implementation will allow for manual additions to credits and EXP, allowing future expansions and special distributions of weekly points, to be specified at a later date through the KIP process.

### Ending $KWENTA rewards on v2:

Implementation of this program will trigger an end to all trading and affiliate rewards on v2 on Optimism. Inflationary rewards currently earmarked for v2 trading rewards will be diverted to the treasury for use in future distributions for points program participants, and will be distributed at the discretion of the treasury.

## Rewards

Weekly rewards and retroactive rewards at token generation will be distributed at the discretion of the treasury. This proposal suggests at least 300 $KWENTA per week for ongoing rewards, and consideration of the number of epochs elapsed should be taken into account for retroactive rewards at $KSX token generation.
