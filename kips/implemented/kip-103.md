## Simple Summary

The proposal seeks to change the existing council epoch from 6 to 4 months. It introduces nomination and inactivity rules to increase community participation, council responsibility, and overall governance effectiveness.

## Abstract

This proposal recommends shortening the Kwenta Council term to four months, introducing eligibility requirements for nominees, and establishing protocols for council member inactivity. These changes are designed to boost community engagement and ensure consistent council participation and accountability. Election procedures, voting responsibilities, and vacancy fulfillment are also streamlined to align with the revised governance timeline.

## Motivation

* Community Engagement: More frequent elections enhance community interaction, keeping engagement levels high.
* Council Responsibility & Activity: Clear guidelines for inactivity and replacement ensure a continuously active and accountable council, preventing governance stagnation.
The proposal aims to enhance community involvement, while ensuring high levels of accountability and activity within the governing body.

## Specification

Nomination and Election
* Token holders will vote every four months to elect the 5-member Kwenta Council. Any other periods connected with council epoch will be adjusted to 4 months too.
* To qualify for nomination, individual must have a Discord account older than 6 months and to be a Kwenta discord member for at least 3 months. 
* Nomination occurs on Discord during a period opened by adminDAO at the end of an epoch.

Responsibilities
* The Kwenta Council is authorized to vote on Kwenta Improvement Proposals (KIPs).
    * KIP vote window should be set within the timeframe of 3 to 7 days. 
* A simple majority (more than 50% votes) is required to pass standard KIPs.
    * For Meta-Governance proposals, n-1 votes are needed, where n is the total number of current council seats.

Inactivity and Replacement
* A council member who misses at least 2 consecutive KIP votes is considered inactive.
* The remaining council members can unanimously vote to remove the inactive member(s).
* To consider a council member inactive, the KIP votes needs to be at least 7 days apart and each KIP should have at least 3 days vote window.

Filling Vacancies
* If one council seat is vacant, the nominee with the highest votes (and at least 1% of total voting power) from the last election is promoted to council member.
* If two or more seats are vacant or no suitable nominee is available, new elections are to be held within 30 days.
