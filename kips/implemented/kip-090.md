## Simple Summary
Change pDAO (protocolDAO) from 3/4 -> 3/5.

## Abstract
Amend pDAO to support 3/5 signers and add an additional CC signer.

## Motivation
Currently, the pDAO is 3/4 where one of the 3rd signers must be a multisig, adminDAO or Elite Council. This doesn't solve the original issue of the adminDAO maintaining less responsibility over the contracts (as the adminDAO is typically the last signer and 2/3 members of the adminDAO still need to verify each upgrade). 

We propose adding an additional technical CC to the pDAO. Having a 3/5 requirement with three technical CCs alleviates the responsibilities of the adminDAO and EC while also balancing control of the protocol.

## Specification
Change `oeth:0xe826d43961a87fBE71C91d9B73F7ef9b16721C07` to be a multsig requiring 3/5 signatures where the additional signer is a CC.
