## Simple Summary

Create an entity that helps the DAO manage IP, expenses, and compliance.

## Abstract

Kwenta Core Contributors will work with Horizons and counsel to establish an orphaned entity in the Cayman Islands.

## Motivation

Kwenta currently has scalability issues: Kwenta code is currently open source, meaning all code can be forked by others, leaving the DAO vulnerable to developers seeking to copy code and Kwenta cannot take on large expenses as this burdens community members being issued grants for handling costs. Additionally, many traditional institutions cannot establish business relations with DAOs that do not have compliance regimes, which limits our prospective users significantly. In order for the DAO to mature as a competitive trading platform, Kwenta needs an entity that addresses these pain points.

## Specification

**The nature of this KIP is exploratory and subject to feasibility.**

This KIP includes the following deliverables:

- Horizons will work with appropriate counsel to structure an orphaned entity in the Cayman Islands which the Kwenta DAO will manage.
- The Core Contributors will move any sensitive IP under the control of the orphaned entity, or a proper subsidiary of the entity.
- The Core Contributors will work with the orphaned entity to establish a system to handle expenses.
- The Core Contributors and Horizons will work with the orphaned entity to establish compliance standards that allow centralized entities to interface with Kwenta.

This KIP suggests to add the following new paragraph to section 7:

> ## Kwenta DAO Legal Entity
>
> Kwenta operates and manages an orphaned entity registered in the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands in order to handle IP, DAO expenses and compliance.
