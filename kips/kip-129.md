## Simple Summary

Revise the Kwenta referral program to reward both traders and affiliates with 0.05 $OP tokens per $1,000 in trading volume, using volume as the criteria for generating rewards. Rewards will be distributed until the 200,000 $OP from Kwenta’s OP grant are distributed.

## Abstract

This KIP proposes an update to the Kwenta referral program to enhance user participation by rewarding both the Trader and the Affiliate with 0.05 $OP tokens per $1,000 in trading volume. The “KWENTA” referral code will be ineligible for affiliate rewards, but users of the “KWENTA” referral code will be eligible for trading rewards.

## Motivation

The change aims to increase participation in the Kwenta referral program by incentivizing both traders and affiliates in direct proportion to volume with liquid rewards. By using trading volume as the reward criterion, the program becomes simpler and more transparent.

## Specification

### Referral Program Structure

- **Reward Structure**: Provide 0.05 $OP tokens per $1,000 in trading volume to both the Trader and the Affiliate.
- **Exclusion**: Exclude the "KWENTA" referral code from earning affiliate rewards; only the trader will receive rewards in this case.

### Referral Dashboard
Update the dashboard to allow manual referral code input for traders,volume generated as a trader since the start of the program, and estimated rewards earned.
Update the affiliate dashboard to show the total volume generated from referrals, the number of traders referred, and estimated rewards earned.
Enable a claim of OP rewards in the UI and link or otherwise indicate the location of this claim in the referral dashboard.

### Data Availability
In compliance with the terms of the Optimism grant, a dashboard should be created to show the number of traders and affiliates using the referral program, the daily and total volume being generated by referred traders, and the amount of OP tokens distributed.
