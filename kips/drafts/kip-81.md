title: adminDAO funding
status: draft

## Simple Summary
This proposal aims to bring a process for the adminDAO to acquire requisite funding to meet its milestone obligation.
## Abstract
This KIP infuses clarity around the procedures that the current and future adminDAO need to adopt when seeking funding from the overarching KwentaDAO, and, by extension, its treasury.
## Motivation
Currently, there is absence of a clearly-defined methodology for the adminDAO to secure funds to ensure the continued development of Kwenta. This KIP is designed to address this.
## Specification
In the existing governance framework, Kwenta Treasury retains complete control over all treasury assets, currently held within the multisig safes on Ethereum & Optimism. Any movement of DAO funds necessitates a passed KTR proposal for fund accessibility. This democratic process allows any group, including the current core contributors through the adminDAO, to put forth a funding proposal.
In the spirit of fair treatment, the adminDAO, just as any other entity soliciting funds from the KwentaDAO, should formulate a per epoch KTR delineating a thorough funding request based on slotted roadmap deliverables. This request should offer a high-level overview of the proposed fund allocation for the ensuing six months of roadmap development. In the event funding needs unexpectedly change during the epochs course it will be necessary to submit a follow up KTR.
