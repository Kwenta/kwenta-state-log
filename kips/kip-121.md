## Summary
Lower the conditional orders fee to .0003 ETH. 

## Abstract
The current gas fee for conditional orders is fixed at .002 ETH, however, the cost of executing an order is closer to .0003 ETH on average. We propose to lower the fixed fee.

## Motivation
With the successful launch of EIP-4844 gas costs are coming down on Optimism & the DAO needs to adjust the exectutor fee for Advanced orders to reflect & account for these decreases in network costs. 

## Specification
Executors fees for Kwenta advanced orders pre eip-4844 ran about .0035 ETH with the the gas optimizations included in the recently lauched EIP Kwenta can lower the executor fee
