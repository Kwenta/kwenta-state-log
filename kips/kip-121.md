## Summary
Raise the conditional orders fee to .0035 ETH. 

## Abstract
The current gas fee for conditional orders is fixed at .002 ETH, however, the cost of executing an order is closer to .0035 ETH on average. We propose to raise the fixed fee to .0035 ETH.

## Motivation
The Kwenta adminDAO is subsidizing the cost of conditional orders to incentivize the usage of conditional orders. With gas costs rising on Optimism the DAO is burning through ETH in the form of subsidies. 

## Specification
The adminDAO is subsidizing roughly 1/3s of the cost of conditional orders. At current ETH prices (~$4000 at the time of writing) and gas prices the average cost per conditional order is around $14 (.0035 ETH). The adminDAO is paying $4 of each order.

The proposal to raise the fee to .0035 ETH would cut any cost to the DAO. 

The protocolDAO is to call `setExecutorFee` on [Settings.sol](0x865dA103d126b3Be3599D84caB57109A861F5631) with the param `3500000000000000` (.0035 ETH)
