## Summary
Lower the conditional orders fee to .0003 ETH. 

## Abstract
The current gas fee for conditional orders is fixed at .002 ETH, however, the cost of executing an order is closer to .0003 ETH on average. We propose to lower the fixed fee.

## Motivation
With the successful launch of EIP-4844, gas costs on Optimism have been significantly reduced. In response, the DAO must re-calibrate the conditional order execution fee that was established for a less efficient network.

## Specification
Before EIP-4844, Kwenta conditional orders incurred an average execution fee of over 0.035 ETH per order. The SMv2 ``Settings.sol`` contract includes a variable ``(executorFee)`` that sets the fee paid to the executor. EIP-4844 introduces a more cost-effective way for Optimism to record transactions on Ethereum, thereby decreasing the gas required for order processing. Reducing the ``executorFee`` as suggested will significantly lower the fees Kwenta traders pay.
