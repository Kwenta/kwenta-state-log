## Simple Summary

This KIP proposes a solution to distribute missed staking rewards (4290 KWENTA) to v1 stakers following the reverse migration of v2 staking.

## Abstract

The proposal suggests directing additional inflation, towards $KWENTA stakers for a period of 2 weeks in order to rectify missed rewards, sourcing this additional inflation by reducing inflation directed at the treasury to.

## Motivation

The migration from v1 to v2 staking resulted in the exclusion of those who remained staked in v1 or did not claim in v2 from receiving their normal staking rewards. As historical staking balances in the v1 system are not accurately obtainable, it is necessary to implement a solution that closely approximates the missed distribution.

By distributing additional inflation over 2 weeks to $KWENTA stakers, overall inflationary rewards directed toward stakers will increase by approximately the same amount as missed rewards, within about 0.2 $KWENTA of the target amount.


## Specification

Allocate additional inflation towards $KWENTA stakers from the treasury for a period of 2 weeks, beginning at the start of the next inflationary epoch.

At the end of the 2-week period, inflation allocation will revert to previous levels as specified in the KSL.
