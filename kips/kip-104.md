## Simple Summary
Remove the role of Management Contributor from the DAO. 

## Abstract
Move the responsibilities of the Management Contributor role to the adminDAO. 

## Motivation
The Management Contributors have offered structure in the early days of Kwenta as senior DAO members have been given an additional role to assist with resource management, prioritization, and general oversight of the DAO. At this stage of the DAOs maturity, these roles are no longer needed and can be managed by the adminDAO. 

## Specification
A few changes will need to be made for this KIP: 

1. Update the KSL to reflect that there is no longer Management Contributors and that adminDAO will be replacing their function
1. Give the Core Contributors the adminDAO seat owned by the Management Contributors meaning Core Contributors will elect two adminDAO members moving forward.
1. Remove Management Contributors from DAO role compensation
