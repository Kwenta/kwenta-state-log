## Summary
The proposal seeks to expand the existing 5-member Kwenta Council to a 7-member structure. It introduces nomination and inactivity rules to increase community participation, council responsibility, and overall governance effectiveness.

## Abstract 
Nomination and Election
Token holders will vote every four months to elect the 7-member Kwenta Council.
To qualify for nomination, individuals must have been active members of the Kwenta community for a minimum of 3 months within the past 6 months.
Nomination occurs on Discord during a period opened by adminDAO at the end of an epoch.

#### Eligibility
- A council member cannot hold any other active role within Kwenta DAO (e.g., Kwenta treasury, AdminDAO, Management Contributor).
- Kwenta CC can be a member of the Kwenta Council.

#### Responsibilities
- The Kwenta Council is authorized to vote on Kwenta Improvement Proposals (KIPs).
  - A simple majority (4/7 votes) is required to pass standard KIPs.
  - For Meta-Governance proposals, n-1 votes are needed, where n is the total number of current council seats.

#### Inactivity and Replacement
- A council member who misses at least 2 consecutive KIP votes is considered inactive.
- The remaining council members can unanimously vote (6/6) to remove the inactive member.

#### Filling Vacancies
- If one seat is vacant, the nominee with the highest votes (and at least 1% of total voting power) from the last election is promoted to council member.
- If two or more seats are vacant or no suitable nominee is available, new elections are to be held within 30 days.

## Motivation
1. Effectivity: The addition of two more seats allows for more expertise and varied perspectives, contributing to better decision-making.
1. Decentralization: Increasing the number of members from 5 to 7 furthers decentralization, distributing power and reducing individual influence.
1. Community Engagement: An expanded council and more frequent elections enhance community interaction, keeping engagement levels high.
1. Council Responsibility & Activity: Clear guidelines for inactivity and replacement ensure a continuously active and accountable council, preventing governance stagnation.
1. The proposal aims to balance council size and community involvement, while ensuring high levels of accountability and activity within the governing body.
