## Simple Summary

Trial adding a small fee to the Synthetix V2 perps integration.

## Abstract

Add a 0.5bp (0.005%) fee to Synthetix V2 markets. 

## Motivation

Synthetix V3 and Perennial markets will offer a superior offering to Synthetix V2 markets. To continue to maintain the V2 markets funding will be required. This proposal addresses that issue by placing a small maintenance fee on the Synthetix V2 markets to ensure users of these markets continue to benefit from an exceptional UX. Additionally, Synthetix V3 and Perennial both offer higher incentives (20% fee share and 35% fee share respectively) which will assume priority for the DAO as there is higher material benefit; by adding a fee to V2, there continues to be a material benefit for servicing these markets as well as gradually encourage users to migrate. The proposal will also include a clause to remove the fee after a one month trial in order to ensure that the fee is not harmful to our market position. 

## Specification

Add a 0.5bp fee on all V2 markets. This fee can be subject to incremental increases as other liquidity sources take priority for resourcing.

In the event of a material drop in volume occurs over a period of one month, the fee can be removed.
